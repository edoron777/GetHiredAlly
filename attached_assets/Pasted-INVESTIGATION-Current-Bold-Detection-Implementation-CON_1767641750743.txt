INVESTIGATION: Current Bold Detection Implementation

CONTEXT:
I need to improve bold text detection in the DOCX extraction function.
Currently, some bold text from the original Word document is not being detected.

Example problem:
- Original Word: "**AI Security & Governance** • LLM security, prompt injection..."
- Extracted: "AI Security & Governance • LLM security, prompt injection..." (no [BOLD] marker)

INVESTIGATION TASKS:

1. SHOW ME THE EXTRACTION FUNCTION:
   Find and display the function _extract_docx_with_markers() 
   Location should be in: backend/app/cv.py
   Show me the COMPLETE function code.

2. SHOW ME BOLD DETECTION LOGIC:
   - How does the current code check for bold text?
   - Does it check: run.bold?
   - Does it check: run.font.bold?
   - Does it check: paragraph.style.font.bold?
   - Does it check inherited bold from styles?

3. SHOW ME MARKER OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - What format are [BOLD] markers added in?
   - Is it [BOLD]text[/BOLD] or just [BOLD] prefix?

4. SHOW ME HOW MARKERS ARE USED:
   - Where is convert_markers_to_html() or similar function?
   - How does Document View use the [BOLD] markers?

5. TEST WITH SAMPLE:
   If possible, show me what the extraction produces for a document
   that has bold text applied via:
   a) Direct bold on text
   b) Bold from paragraph style
   c) Bold from character style

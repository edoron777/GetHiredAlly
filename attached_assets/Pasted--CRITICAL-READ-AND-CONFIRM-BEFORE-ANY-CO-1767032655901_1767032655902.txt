CRITICAL: READ AND CONFIRM BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES
==========================================================

I am about to give you instructions to implement a CV Scoring module.

BEFORE YOU WRITE ANY CODE, you must understand and confirm these rules:

=== RULE 1: ZERO IMPROVISATION ===
- Do ONLY what I explicitly request
- Do NOT add features I didn't ask for
- Do NOT "improve" existing code not mentioned
- Do NOT make "helpful" additions
- If something is unclear → ASK, don't guess

=== RULE 2: PROTECTED FILES ===
Before making ANY changes:
1. Check AGENTS.md for protected files
2. Check replit.md for project guidelines
3. If a file is protected → DO NOT MODIFY without my explicit approval
4. If you need to modify a protected file → ASK FIRST

=== RULE 3: SCOPE BOUNDARIES ===
- Work ONLY in the files/folders I specify
- Do NOT touch unrelated code
- Do NOT refactor code I didn't mention
- Do NOT "clean up" other parts of the codebase

=== RULE 4: VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION ===
After each task, you MUST provide:
1. List of ALL files created
2. List of ALL files modified
3. List of ALL changes made
4. Confirmation that ONLY requested changes were made

=== RULE 5: ASK WHEN UNCERTAIN ===
- If instructions are unclear → STOP and ASK
- If you see multiple interpretations → ASK which one
- If something seems wrong → ASK before changing
- NEVER assume my intent

=== RULE 6: NO SIDE EFFECTS ===
- Do NOT change imports in unrelated files
- Do NOT modify configuration files unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT update dependencies unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT change database schemas unless explicitly asked

=== CONFIRMATION REQUIRED ===

Before I give you the implementation prompts, please confirm:

1. "I understand I must do ONLY what is explicitly requested"
2. "I will check AGENTS.md and replit.md before modifying files"
3. "I will NOT improvise or add unrequested features"
4. "I will ASK if anything is unclear"
5. "I will provide a summary of ALL changes after each task"

Please respond with these 5 confirmations, then I will proceed with the first implementation prompt.

## UI Updates for "Understand This Job" Page

Make these visual improvements to the service input page:

### 1. Page Title Change
- Change main title from "Understand This Job" to "Analyze This Job Description"
- Add a smaller subtitle below: "Deep analysis of what they're looking for"

### 2. Add Paste Icon to Ally Message
- Add a clipboard icon (📋 or use Lucide's ClipboardPaste icon) at the START of the message text
- Message becomes: [clipboard icon] "Paste the job description and I'll help you understand what they're really looking for."

### 3. Make Job Description Label More Prominent
- Increase font size of "Job Description *" label (make it text-lg or text-xl, around 18-20px)
- Make it bold (font-semibold or font-bold)
- Add slightly more margin-bottom to separate it from the textarea

### 4. Visual Separation Before Analysis Mode
- Add a horizontal divider line OR increased spacing (margin-top: 32px or more) before "Analysis Mode" section
- Optionally add a subtle section header: "Choose Analysis Depth" or just "Analysis Mode" in a slightly larger font

### 5. Reduce Analysis Mode Card Height
- Current cards are too tall - reduce the height significantly
- Target height: approximately 80-100px max (or let content determine with minimal padding)
- Reduce vertical padding inside cards (py-3 instead of py-6)
- Cards should look like selection buttons, not large info cards
- Keep the icon, title, description, and read time - just more compact

### 6. Analysis Mode Button Styling
Change the mode selection cards to have clearer button-like appearance:

**Unselected state:**
- Background: white (#FFFFFF)
- Border: 1px solid light gray (#E5E7EB)
- Text: dark gray/navy

**Selected state:**
- Background: very light navy/blue (#E8F0F5 or similar)
- Border: 2px solid navy (#1E3A5F)
- Optional: subtle shadow
- Keep text dark (readable)

**Hover state:**
- Background: light gray (#F9FAFB)
- Border: gray (#D1D5DB)
- Cursor: pointer

### Important Notes:
- Do NOT use dark backgrounds for these selection cards
- The submit button "Analyze This Job" should remain the darkest/most prominent element
- Selected card should be clearly distinguishable but not overwhelming
- All three cards should be the same width and height

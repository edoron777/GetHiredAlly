## TASK: Fix X-Ray Analyzer Page - 3 Issues

### ISSUE 1: Remove "Analysis Mode" Section

The current "Analysis Mode" section has 3 options (Quick Prep, Deep Dive, Max Insight).

DELETE this entire section.

### ISSUE 2: Replace with "How much time do you have?" Section

Add a NEW section after "Who will interview you?" with these specs:

Section header: "How much time do you have?"

2 selection cards side by side (equal width):

**Card 1: Interview Ready**
- Icon: Zap icon (from lucide-react)
- Label: "Interview Ready"
- Sublabel line 1: "Essential points"
- Sublabel line 2: "5-10 min read"

**Card 2: Fully Prepared**
- Icon: ClipboardList icon (from lucide-react)
- Label: "Fully Prepared"
- Sublabel line 1: "Complete analysis"
- Sublabel line 2: "20-30 min read"

**Card Styling (same as interviewer cards):**
- Unselected: white background, 1px solid #E5E7EB border
- Selected: #E8F0F5 background, 2px solid #1E3A5F border
- Hover (not selected): 1px solid #1E3A5F border
- Height: ~100px
- Border radius: 8px

**State variable:** 
- depthLevel: 'ready' | 'full' | null

### ISSUE 3: Fix Primary Button Color

The "Analyze Job Description" button (or "Generate My Prep Report") should be navy blue BEFORE clicking, not after.

**Button styling when ENABLED:**
- Background color: #1E3A5F (navy blue)
- Text color: white
- This should be the DEFAULT state when button is enabled

**Button styling when DISABLED:**
- Background color: #1E3A5F with opacity 0.5
- OR Background color: #9CA3AF (gray)
- Cursor: not-allowed

**Button text:** Change to "Generate My Prep Report"

### VALIDATION LOGIC

Button should be ENABLED only when ALL three are true:
1. Job description has text (minimum 100 characters)
2. Interviewer type is selected (hr, technical, manager, or general)
3. Depth level is selected (ready or full)

### DATA TO SEND ON SUBMIT

When button is clicked, send to backend:
{
  jobDescription: string,
  interviewerType: 'hr' | 'technical' | 'manager' | 'general',
  depthLevel: 'ready' | 'full'
}

For now, console.log this data - we'll connect backend next.

### SUMMARY OF CHANGES

1. DELETE: "Analysis Mode" section with Quick Prep / Deep Dive / Max Insight
2. ADD: "How much time do you have?" section with Interview Ready / Fully Prepared
3. FIX: Button color should be navy (#1E3A5F) when enabled, BEFORE user clicks
4. CHANGE: Button text to "Generate My Prep Report"

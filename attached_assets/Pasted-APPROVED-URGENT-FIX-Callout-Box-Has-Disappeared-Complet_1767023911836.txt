## URGENT FIX: Callout Box Has Disappeared Completely

### THE PROBLEM
The Callout box is now COMPLETELY GONE from the page.
It was there before. Now it's missing.

BEFORE (what it looked like):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Quick Wins Available                                      │
│ Start with 4 quick fixes below - they take just minutes...  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

NOW:
Nothing. The callout box is completely missing.

### WHAT HAPPENED
While trying to make the callout dynamic, the component was probably:
- Deleted by mistake
- Broken by syntax error
- Hidden by conditional that's always false

### FIX STEPS

STEP 1: Check git history or recent changes
Look at what was changed in CVReportPage.tsx in the last edit.
Find where the callout was removed or broken.

STEP 2: Restore the callout
If deleted, add it back. Here's what it should look like:

{/* Callout Box - Place after Filter by priority section */}
<div className="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
  <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <span className="text-xl">⚡</span>
    <div>
      <h4 className="font-semibold text-amber-800">Quick Wins Available</h4>
      <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm">
        Start with {quickWinsCount} quick fixes below - they take just minutes and have big impact!
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

STEP 3: Make sure it renders
Check there's no conditional hiding it:

WRONG:
{showCallout && <CalloutBox />}  // if showCallout is false, nothing shows

CORRECT:
<CalloutBox />  // Always show (for now)

STEP 4: Verify it appears
After restoring, the callout box must be visible on the page.

### LOCATION
File: CVReportPage.tsx
Position: After "Filter by priority" section, before the issues list

### DO NOT
- Do not make it dynamic yet
- First just restore it so it shows
- We will make it dynamic in the next step

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Callout box is visible on the page
- [ ] Shows "Quick Wins Available" text
- [ ] Has yellow/amber background color
- [ ] Has icon on the left

TASK: Move the Detail Level selector to directly above the recommendations list

OBJECTIVE:
Reposition the Detail Level control so it's next to what it affects (recommendations display)

CONTEXT:
Currently the Detail Level selector is positioned too high on the page, separated from the recommendations it controls. Users should see the control next to what it controls.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: In the CV Report page component, locate the Detail Level section
- Search for: "How much information do you want to see?"
- Or: "Quick Review", "Standard", "With Fix", "Complete"
- Or: "detailLevel", "DetailLevel"

Step 2: IDENTIFY the current position in the JSX structure
- Note what comes BEFORE it
- Note what comes AFTER it

Step 3: CUT the entire Detail Level section (the container div with the question and 4 buttons)

Step 4: PASTE it in the NEW position:
- AFTER the Priority Filter (All / Quick Wins / Important / Consider / Polish)
- BEFORE the recommendations list
- Add a divider/separator line above it if there isn't one

Step 5: The new order should be:
1. Category Filter (checkboxes)
2. View By (Priority / Effort / Work Type)
3. Priority Filter (All / Quick Wins / etc.)
4. --- divider ---
5. Detail Level (Quick Review / Standard / With Fix / Complete) ← MOVED HERE
6. Recommendations List

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FILES TO MODIFY:
- [CV Report page component]

FILES TO CREATE:
- None

DO NOT TOUCH:
- Detail Level component internal code
- Category Filter component
- View By component
- Priority Filter component
- Recommendations List component

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHEN COMPLETE:

Confirm:
□ Detail Level selector appears after Priority Filter
□ Detail Level selector appears before Recommendations
□ A visual separator exists between Priority Filter and Detail Level
□ Detail Level buttons still work correctly
□ Selecting different levels still changes recommendation display
□ No console errors

Report the before/after positions.

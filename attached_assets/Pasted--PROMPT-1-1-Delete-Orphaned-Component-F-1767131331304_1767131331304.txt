TASK: Delete orphaned component files that are no longer used

OBJECTIVE:
Remove files that were part of the old layout and are no longer 
imported anywhere in the codebase

CONTEXT:
After the CV Optimizer Report page restructure, these components 
are no longer used:
- StrengthsSection (removed "What's Working Well" feature)
- ActionBar (replaced with ExportDropdown)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: VERIFY these files are not imported anywhere
- Search entire codebase for: "StrengthsSection"
- Search entire codebase for: "ActionBar"
- If either IS still imported somewhere, STOP and report

Step 2: DELETE the following files (if verification passed):

FILE 1: client/src/components/cv-optimizer/StrengthsSection.tsx

FILE 2: client/src/components/common/ActionBar/
- Delete the entire ActionBar folder and all files inside it
- This includes: index.tsx, ActionBar.tsx, or any other files in that folder

Step 3: Verify no import errors appear after deletion
- Check console for errors
- Check for red underlines in other files

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FILES TO DELETE:
- client/src/components/cv-optimizer/StrengthsSection.tsx
- client/src/components/common/ActionBar/ (entire folder)

FILES TO MODIFY:
- None

DO NOT TOUCH:
- All other files
- CVReportPage.tsx (already cleaned up)
- ExportDropdown.tsx (new component, keep it)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHEN COMPLETE:

Confirm:
□ Verified StrengthsSection is not imported anywhere
□ Verified ActionBar is not imported anywhere
□ StrengthsSection.tsx deleted
□ ActionBar folder deleted
□ No import errors in console
□ No red underlines in other files
□ Application still runs correctly

Report what was deleted.

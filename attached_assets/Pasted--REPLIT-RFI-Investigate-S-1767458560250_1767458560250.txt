REPLIT: RFI - Investigate Section Extraction (DO NOT MODIFY CODE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION PROMPT - DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE ⚠️

CONTEXT:
We added length_detector.py which requires parsed CV sections:
- summary_text (string)
- experience_entries (list of dicts with: company, title, bullets)
- education_entries (list of dicts with: institution, degree, description)
- years_experience (int)

We need to understand how sections are currently extracted.

INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. SECTION EXTRACTION FILE:
   - Is there a section_extractor.py or similar file?
   - File path: __________
   - What functions does it export?

2. CV PARSING FLOW:
   - Where does CV text get parsed into sections?
   - What is the data structure returned?
   - Show the relevant function signature and return type.

3. EXPERIENCE EXTRACTION:
   - Is work experience currently being parsed?
   - What format is it in? Show example structure.
   - Are bullet points extracted separately?

4. EDUCATION EXTRACTION:
   - Is education currently being parsed?
   - What format is it in? Show example structure.

5. SUMMARY EXTRACTION:
   - Is the Professional Summary being extracted?
   - What format is it in?

6. MASTER DETECTOR INTEGRATION:
   - In master_detector.py, what variables are available?
   - Show the main detection function and its parameters.
   - What parsed data is passed to it?

7. DATA FLOW:
   Trace: CV Upload → Parsing → Detection
   - Where does parsing happen?
   - What gets passed to detectors?

REPORT FORMAT:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Please report findings in this format:

FINDING 1 - Section Extraction Location:

- Returns: [data structure]

FINDING 2 - Experience Data Structure:
- Currently extracted: YES/NO
- Format: [show structure]
- Includes bullets: YES/NO

FINDING 3 - Education Data Structure:
- Currently extracted: YES/NO
- Format: [show structure]

FINDING 4 - Summary Data Structure:

GAP ANALYSIS:
What's missing to connect length_detector.py?
- [ ] Summary text extraction
- [ ] Experience entries in correct format
- [ ] Education entries in correct format
- [ ] Years of experience calculation

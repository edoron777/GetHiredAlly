# Replit Query: Verify Existing Detection Coverage

**Purpose:** Determine which issue types already have detection code vs need new code  
**Type:** INVESTIGATION (not implementation)  
**Date:** January 3, 2026

---

## CONTEXT

I need to add new CV issue types. Before deciding whether to update only the database or also write new detection code, I need to verify what the existing detectors already return.

---

## QUESTIONS

### Question 1: Contact Extractor Coverage

**File:** `backend/common/detection/contact_extractor.py`

Please show me:
1. All `issue_type` values this detector can return
2. Does it detect `CONTACT_MISSING_GITHUB` or similar?

**Search for:** All strings that look like `'issue_type': 'CONTACT_...'`

---

### Question 2: Section Extractor Coverage

**File:** `backend/common/detection/section_extractor.py`

Please show me:
1. All `issue_type` values this detector can return
2. Does it detect `CONTENT_MISSING_SUMMARY` or similar?
3. Does it detect section order issues?

**Search for:** All strings that look like `'issue_type': '...'`

---

### Question 3: Employment Gap Detection

**Search all detection files** for:
- "gap" (case insensitive)
- "employment"
- "CAREER_EMPLOYMENT_GAP"

Does any detector check for employment gaps between jobs?

---

### Question 4: Format Detector Coverage

**File:** `backend/common/detection/format_detector.py`

Please show me:
1. All `issue_type` values this detector can return
2. Does it detect any of these?
   - Section order violations
   - Skills in paragraph format
   - Non-standard section headers
   - Content in headers/footers

---

### Question 5: Length/Section Detector Coverage

**Files:** `backend/common/detection/section_extractor.py` or any length-related detector

Does any detector check:
- Summary word count (too long/too short)?
- Experience dates older than 15 years?

---

### Question 6: Complete Issue Type List

**Run this search across ALL files in `backend/common/detection/`:**

```bash
grep -r "issue_type" backend/common/detection/ | grep -oP "'issue_type':\s*'[A-Z_]+'" | sort | uniq
```

Or manually list ALL unique `issue_type` values returned by all detectors.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT

```markdown
## Detector Coverage Report

### 1. contact_extractor.py
Issues detected:
- CONTACT_MISSING_EMAIL ✅
- CONTACT_MISSING_PHONE ✅
- CONTACT_MISSING_LINKEDIN ✅
- CONTACT_MISSING_GITHUB ❌ NOT FOUND
- ...

### 2. section_extractor.py
Issues detected:
- CONTENT_... ✅
- ...

### 3. Employment Gap
Found: YES/NO
Location: [file if found]

### 4. format_detector.py
Issues detected:
- FORMAT_... ✅
- ...

### 5. Summary Length / Old Experience
Summary length check: YES/NO
Experience age check: YES/NO

### 6. COMPLETE LIST OF ALL ISSUE_TYPES IN CODE
[Full list of every issue_type string found in detection code]
```

## WHY THIS MATTERS

| If issue_type EXISTS in code | If issue_type NOT in code |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Only need DB INSERT | Need code change + DB INSERT |
| TipBox will work immediately | Must write detection logic first |

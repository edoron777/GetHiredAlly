# 🔍 Investigation Prompt: Side-by-Side Component Architecture

## OBJECTIVE
Map all code related to the Side-by-Side view in CV Optimizer to understand its structure before making it reusable.

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### 1. File Structure
List ALL files involved in the Side-by-Side functionality:
- Main component file(s)
- Supporting components
- Hooks used
- Utility functions
- Type definitions
- CSS/styling files

### 2. Component Structure
For each file found, document:
- Component/function name
- Props accepted
- State managed
- What it renders

### 3. Data Flow
Explain the data flow:
- What data does Side-by-Side receive? (original CV, fixed CV, issues, etc.)
- What format is the data in?
- How are differences calculated/highlighted?
- How is sync scrolling implemented (if any)?

### 4. Dependencies
List all imports used by Side-by-Side:
- External packages (react, etc.)
- Internal components (TipBox, DocStyler, etc.)
- Hooks
- Types

### 5. Current Integration
How is Side-by-Side currently triggered?
- What button/tab activates it?
- What state controls which view is shown?
- Is there a viewMode state variable?

### 6. Specific Functions
Document these specific functions if they exist:
- Function that renders the "Original CV" panel
- Function that renders the "Fixed CV" panel
- Function that highlights differences
- Function that syncs scrolling between panels

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide a structured report with:
1. File paths and purposes
2. Component tree diagram
3. Props/interfaces definitions
4. Key functions with their signatures
```

## Service 1 Input Page: "Understand This Job"

Build the first service page for the X-Ray Analyzer.

### Route
- URL: /service/understand-job (or /understand-job)
- Access: Authenticated users only (redirect to login if not logged in)

### Page Layout

**Top Section:**
- Breadcrumb: "Home > Understand This Job"
- Page title: "Understand This Job"
- Subtitle (Ally message in a soft card): "Paste the job description and I'll help you understand what they're really looking for."

**Main Form Section:**

1. **Job Description Input**
   - Large textarea (minimum 10 rows, expandable)
   - Placeholder: "Paste the complete job description here..."
   - Required field
   - Character count shown below (e.g., "0 characters")

2. **Analysis Mode Selector** (Radio buttons or card-style selection)
   
   Three options displayed as cards:
   
   | Mode | Label | Description | Read Time |
   |------|-------|-------------|-----------|
   | quick | ⚡ Quick Prep | Get the essentials fast | 10-15 min read |
   | deep | 🔍 Deep Dive | Comprehensive analysis (Recommended) | 30-45 min read |
   | max | 🎯 Max Insight | Leave no stone unturned | 60-90 min read |
   
   - Default selected: "Deep Dive" (deep)
   - Each card should show the label, description, and read time
   - Visual indicator for selected mode (border color or checkmark)

3. **Submit Button**
   - Text: "Analyze This Job"
   - Disabled until job description has at least 100 characters
   - Shows loading state when clicked (will connect to API later)

**Additional Elements:**
- Small info text under mode selector: "Choose based on how much time you have. You can always run a deeper analysis later."

### Styling
- Use the existing design system (beige background, navy blue accents)
- Cards for mode selection should match the service cards style from dashboard
- Form should be centered with max-width around 800px
- Add subtle validation styling (red border if empty on blur after interaction)

### Database Interaction (for this prompt)
- No database save yet (that comes in next prompt)
- Just build the UI and form validation
- Store form state in React state

### What NOT to build yet
- Do not connect to Claude API yet
- Do not save to database yet
- Do not show results/report yet

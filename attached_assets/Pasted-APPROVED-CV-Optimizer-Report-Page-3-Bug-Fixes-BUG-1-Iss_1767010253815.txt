## CV Optimizer Report Page - 3 Bug Fixes

### BUG 1: Issues Should Be COLLAPSED by Default

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
All issue items are EXPANDED (open) by default when the report loads.

PROBLEM:
- Too much information at once
- Cognitive overload for the user
- User has to scroll through everything

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
All issue items should be COLLAPSED (closed) by default.
User clicks on an item to expand and see details.

LOCATION:
File: CVReportPage.tsx (or wherever issue items are rendered)

FIX:
Find the state that controls expanded/collapsed and set default to FALSE (collapsed).

Example:
// WRONG (current):
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(true);

// CORRECT:
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

Or if using an array of expanded IDs:
// WRONG:
const [expandedItems, setExpandedItems] = useState(allItemIds);

// CORRECT:
const [expandedItems, setExpandedItems] = useState([]);

### BUG 2: Filter Bar Numbers Are WRONG

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
The filter buttons show incorrect counts:
- Quick Wins: 0
- Important: 0
- Consider: 0 (but shows 26 when clicked)
- Polish: 0 (but shows 15 when clicked)

PROBLEM:
The counts displayed on the filter buttons do not match the actual number of items in each category.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Filter buttons should show the CORRECT count of items in each category.
Example: If there are 26 "Consider" items, the button should show "Consider 26"

LOCATION:
File: CVReportPage.tsx - filter bar component

FIX:
The count calculation is wrong. Check how counts are being calculated:

1. Make sure counts are calculated AFTER issues are loaded
2. Make sure counts match the filtering logic
3. Check if severity mapping is correct

Debug by logging:
console.log("Issues:", issues);
console.log("Quick Wins count:", issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'critical').length);
console.log("Important count:", issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'high').length);
console.log("Consider count:", issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'medium').length);
console.log("Polish count:", issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'low').length);

### BUG 3: Remove "Text Size" Toolbar

CURRENT:
There is a "Text Size: [-] [+]" control in the report page.

REQUESTED:
Remove this completely. It is not needed.

LOCATION:
File: CVReportPage.tsx

FIX:
Find and DELETE the Text Size component/section:

Look for something like:
<div>
  Text Size:
  <button>-</button>
  <button>+</button>
</div>

Delete the entire block.

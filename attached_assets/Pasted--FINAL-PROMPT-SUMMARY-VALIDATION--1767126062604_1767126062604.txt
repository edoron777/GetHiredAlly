═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All prompts have been executed. Provide a detailed summary:

1. EXECUTION LOG
   List each prompt and its completion status:
   □ 1#6 - Create Scoring Module Structure and Config - [Status]
   □ 2#6 - Create Main Calculator Function - [Status]
   □ 3#6 - Create Category Scoring Functions (Content & Language) - [Status]
   □ 4#6 - Create Category Scoring Functions (Formatting & Completeness) - [Status]
   □ 5#6 - Update AI Prompt for Structured JSON - [Status]
   □ 6#6 - Integrate Scoring with CV Optimizer Service - [Status]

2. FILES CREATED
   List all new files:
   - server/common/scoring/__init__.py
   - server/common/scoring/config.py
   - server/common/scoring/calculator.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/__init__.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/content_quality.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/language_clarity.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/formatting.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/completeness.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/professional.py
   - server/common/scoring/categories/red_flags.py
   - server/common/scoring/extractors/__init__.py
   - server/common/scoring/extractors/pattern_matcher.py

3. FILES MODIFIED
   List all files that were changed:
   - [filepath] - [what changed]

4. CODE VERIFICATION
   Perform these checks:
   □ All new files are in correct directories
   □ All imports resolve correctly
   □ No syntax errors detected
   □ Weights sum to exactly 100
   □ All category functions return float
   □ calculate_cv_score is callable

5. DETERMINISM TEST
   Run this test to verify determinism:
   ```python
   # Test same input = same output
   test_data = {"contact": {"has_name": True}, ...}
   results = [calculate_cv_score(test_data) for _ in range(10)]
   scores = [r.total_score for r in results]
   assert len(set(scores)) == 1, "FAIL: Scores vary!"
   print("PASS: All scores identical")
   ```

6. INTEGRATION TEST
   Verify the service works:
   □ CV Optimizer service starts
   □ analyze_cv function works
   □ Score breakdown is returned
   □ API endpoints respond

7. ISSUES & WARNINGS
   List any problems encountered:
   - [Issue 1]
   - [Issue 2]

TASK: Remove the "What's Working Well" section from the CV Report page

OBJECTIVE:
Delete the entire strengths/positive feedback section to streamline the user experience

CONTEXT:
Users are focused on FIXING their CV, not celebrating what's good. This section adds cognitive load without providing actionable value.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Find the CV Report page component
- Likely location: src/pages/cv-optimizer/CVReportPage.tsx
- Or similar path containing the report display

Step 2: Search for these terms to locate the section:
- "What's Working Well"
- "Working Well"
- "strengths"
- "StrengthsSection"
- "solid foundation"

Step 3: DELETE the entire component/section that displays:
- "What's Working Well" header
- List of strengths (Clear job titles, Includes quantified achievements, etc.)
- The blue encouragement box with text like "Your CV has a solid foundation..."

Step 4: Remove any related imports at the top of the file
- If there's an import for StrengthsSection or similar, remove it

Step 5: Remove any related state or data fetching for strengths
- If there's useState or data for strengths that's no longer used, remove it

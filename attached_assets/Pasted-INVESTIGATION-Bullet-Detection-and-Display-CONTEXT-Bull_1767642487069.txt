INVESTIGATION TASKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. BULLET DETECTION IN EXTRACTION:
   In backend/app/cv.py, function _extract_docx_with_markers():
   - Show me the code that detects bullets
   - How are [BULLET] markers added?
   - What criteria determine if a line is a bullet?

2. BULLET MARKER CONVERSION:
   In backend/common/utils/marker_converter.py:
   - Show me how [BULLET] markers are converted to HTML
   - Is there a convert function for bullets?

3. TEST EXTRACTION OUTPUT:
   Using a CV that has bullet points:
   - Extract the text and show first 50 lines
   - Are [BULLET] markers present in the extracted text?
   - If not, bullets are not detected during extraction

4. CHECK FRONTEND DISPLAY:
   - How does DocumentView render bullet markers?
   - Is there CSS for bullet styling?

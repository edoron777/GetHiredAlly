## CV Optimizer - 7 UI/UX Fixes

### FIX 1: Dynamic Callout Box Based on Selected Filter

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The "Quick Wins Available" callout always shows regardless of which filter is selected.
Example: Shows "Start with 75 quick fixes" but Quick Wins filter shows "0".

REQUIRED:
1. The callout should change based on the SELECTED filter
2. If "Quick Wins" is selected (and has items): Show Quick Wins callout
3. If "Important" is selected: Show Important callout
4. If "Consider" is selected: Show Consider callout
5. If "Polish" is selected: Show Polish callout
6. If "All" is selected: Show summary or hide callout
7. The NUMBER in the callout must match the actual count

CALLOUT CONTENT BY FILTER:
- Quick Wins: "Start with X quick fixes below - they take just minutes and have big impact!"
- Important: "X important improvements that will significantly strengthen your CV"
- Consider: "X suggestions worth considering to make your CV stand out"
- Polish: "X minor polish items for that extra professional touch"
- All: "X total suggestions found" OR hide callout

LOCATION: CVReportPage.tsx - callout/banner component

### FIX 2: Items COLLAPSED by Default (STILL NOT FIXED)

CURRENT PROBLEM:
All issue items are EXPANDED when the page loads.
This creates visual overload.

REQUIRED:
All items must be COLLAPSED (closed) by default.
User clicks to expand individual items.

THIS WAS REQUESTED BEFORE BUT NOT FIXED.

LOCATION: CVReportPage.tsx
Find the state that controls expanded/collapsed.
Set default to FALSE or empty array.

### FIX 3: Ignore Markdown Formatting in Analysis

CURRENT PROBLEM:
When user uploads a Markdown (.md) file, the AI detects formatting symbols (*, **, #, etc.) as "issues".
This creates false positives.

REQUIRED:
Before sending CV content to AI for analysis:
1. Check if file is Markdown (by extension or content)
2. Strip Markdown formatting symbols:
   - Remove * and ** (bold/italic)
   - Remove # ## ### (headers)
   - Remove []() (links)
   - Remove ``` (code blocks)
   - Keep the actual text content
3. Send clean text to AI

LOCATION: backend/app/cv_optimizer.py or cv.py
Add a function: clean_markdown_for_analysis(text)

Example:
Input: "**David Cohen** | Email: test@email.com"
Output: "David Cohen | Email: test@email.com"

### FIX 4: "How much information" Toolbar - Fix + Add Tooltips

CURRENT PROBLEM:
1. Clicking "Complete" button does nothing
2. Users don't understand what each option means

REQUIRED:
1. Make ALL buttons functional (Quick Review, Standard, With Fix, Complete)
2. Add TOOLTIPS on hover explaining each option:

TOOLTIP TEXT:
- Quick Review: "Show only issue titles - fastest overview"
- Standard: "Show titles with category and location"
- With Fix: "Show titles, location, and how to fix each issue"
- Complete: "Show all details including original text and suggested fix"

IMPLEMENTATION:
Add title attribute or tooltip component to each button.

LOCATION: CVReportPage.tsx - view mode toolbar

---

### FIX 5: "View by" Toolbar - Add Tooltips

CURRENT PROBLEM:
Users don't understand what "By Work Type" means.

REQUIRED:
Add TOOLTIPS on hover for each option:

TOOLTIP TEXT:
- By Priority: "Group issues by severity - Critical, High, Medium, Low"
- By Effort: "Group issues by time to fix - Quick fixes first"
- By Work Type: "Group issues by category - Grammar, Formatting, etc."

LOCATION: CVReportPage.tsx - view by toolbar

---

### FIX 6: Add Sound Effects for Scanning (OPTIONAL)

REQUIRED:
Add subtle audio feedback:
1. Short "start" sound (0.3-0.5 sec) when scanning BEGINS
2. Short "complete" sound (0.3-0.5 sec) when scanning ENDS

SOUNDS:
Use simple, professional tones. Not loud or annoying.
Can use Web Audio API or simple audio files.

Example sounds:
- Start: soft "whoosh" or subtle chime
- Complete: pleasant "ding" or success tone

LOCATION: 
- CVScanningPage.tsx (for CV scan)
- CVReportPage.tsx (for Fix CV generation)

NOTE: This is lower priority. Skip if complex.

### FIX 7: Render Fixed CV Properly (Not Raw Markdown)

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The Fixed CV page shows raw Markdown text with ** and other symbols visible.
Example: "**David Cohen**" instead of "David Cohen" (bold)

REQUIRED:
Render the Fixed CV as formatted text, not raw Markdown.

OPTIONS:
Option A: Convert Markdown to HTML and render
Option B: Strip Markdown symbols and show plain text
Option C: Use a Markdown renderer component

RECOMMENDATION: Option A - Render as HTML for nice formatting

IMPLEMENTATION:
Use a library like react-markdown or marked to render the content.

LOCATION: CVFixedPage.tsx - CV content display

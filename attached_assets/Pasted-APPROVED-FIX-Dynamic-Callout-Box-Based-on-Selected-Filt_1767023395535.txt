## FIX: Dynamic Callout Box Based on Selected Filter

### THE PROBLEM (STILL NOT FIXED)
When user clicks "Consider" filter button, the Callout box STILL shows:
"Quick Wins Available - Start with 4 quick fixes below..."

This is WRONG. The Callout should CHANGE based on which filter is selected.

### CURRENT BEHAVIOR (WRONG)
- User clicks "Consider" (7 items)
- Callout shows: "Quick Wins Available" (WRONG!)

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (CORRECT)
- User clicks "Consider" (7 items)
- Callout shows: "Consider - 7 suggestions worth considering to make your CV stand out"

### STEP BY STEP FIX

STEP 1: Find the filter state
In CVReportPage.tsx, find the state that tracks which filter is selected.
Look for something like:
const [selectedFilter, setSelectedFilter] = useState('all');
or
const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState('all');

DEBUG: Add this line:
console.log("Selected filter:", selectedFilter);

STEP 2: Find the Callout component
Look for the component that renders:
"Quick Wins Available - Start with X quick fixes below..."

It might be hardcoded. Find it.

DEBUG: Add this line above the callout:
console.log("Rendering callout, current filter:", selectedFilter);

STEP 3: Make Callout dynamic
Replace the hardcoded callout with dynamic content:

const getCalloutContent = () => {
  switch (selectedFilter) {
    case 'quick_wins':
    case 'critical':
      return {
        title: "Quick Wins Available",
        message: `Start with ${quickWinsCount} quick fixes below - they take just minutes and have big impact!`,
        icon: "⚡",
        color: "yellow"
      };
    case 'important':
    case 'high':
      return {
        title: "Important Improvements",
        message: `${importantCount} important improvements that will significantly strengthen your CV`,
        icon: "⚠️",
        color: "orange"
      };
    case 'consider':
    case 'medium':
      return {
        title: "Worth Considering",
        message: `${considerCount} suggestions worth considering to make your CV stand out`,
        icon: "💡",
        color: "blue"
      };
    case 'polish':
    case 'low':
      return {
        title: "Polish Items",
        message: `${polishCount} minor polish items for that extra professional touch`,
        icon: "✨",
        color: "green"
      };
    default:
      return {
        title: "All Suggestions",
        message: `${totalCount} total improvement opportunities found`,
        icon: "📋",
        color: "gray"
      };
  }
};

STEP 4: Use the dynamic content
const callout = getCalloutContent();

<div className={`callout callout-${callout.color}`}>
  <span>{callout.icon}</span>
  <div>
    <strong>{callout.title}</strong>
    <p>{callout.message}</p>
  </div>
</div>

### DEBUG CHECKLIST
Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] console.log shows correct filter when clicking buttons
- [ ] Callout title changes when clicking different filters
- [ ] Callout message includes correct count for that filter

### LOCATION
File: CVReportPage.tsx

### DO NOT
- Do not change filter logic
- Do not change other components
- Only fix the Callout to be dynamic

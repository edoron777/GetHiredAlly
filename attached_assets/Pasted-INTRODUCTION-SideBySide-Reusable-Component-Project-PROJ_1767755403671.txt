INTRODUCTION — SideBySide Reusable Component Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
We are creating a unified, reusable SideBySide comparison component for GetHiredAlly Application.

PROBLEM:
Currently there are TWO separate implementations of side-by-side comparison:
1. SideBySideView (in cv-optimizer folder) - used for manual edits
2. CVFixedPage with CVPanel - used for AI auto-fix

This causes:
- Duplicate code maintenance
- Inconsistent behavior
- No code reuse for future services

SOLUTION:
Create ONE reusable component in /common/ folder that:
- Both existing implementations will use
- Future services can easily import
- Has unified interface and behavior
- Includes scroll sync (currently missing in both)

PROMPT SERIES STRUCTURE:
This project consists of 5 prompts:
- Prompt 0: Reconnaissance (already completed)
- Prompt 1: Introduction (this prompt - READ ONLY)
- Prompt 2: Create the new unified SideBySide component
- Prompt 3: Refactor SideBySideView to use new component
- Prompt 4: Refactor CVFixedPage to use new component
- Prompt 5: Verification and cleanup

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL PROMPTS:
1. NO IMPROVISATION — Only implement what is explicitly specified
2. NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES — Do not modify files not mentioned
3. PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY — All current features must continue working
4. MOBILE RESPONSIVE — All components must work on mobile devices
5. SECURITY — Follow secure coding practices

If any prompt instruction is unclear, ASK before implementing.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT make any changes in this prompt. This is context only.
Confirm you understand the project scope before proceeding to Prompt 2.

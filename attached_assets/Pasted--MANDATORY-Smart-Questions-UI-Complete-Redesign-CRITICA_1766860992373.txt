---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE STARTING

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Add ANY features not explicitly requested
- ❌ Add upgrade banners, payment prompts, or "Coming Soon" labels
- ❌ Add new sections or elements of your own design
- ❌ Improvise or be "creative" with the layout
- ❌ Ignore any part of these instructions

**YOU MUST:**
- ✅ Follow these instructions EXACTLY as written
- ✅ Copy the Static Questionnaire layout EXACTLY
- ✅ Ask for clarification if something is unclear
- ✅ Show me the changes before finalizing

**If you add ANYTHING not requested, the task has FAILED.**

## THE TASK

Create a **NEW** Smart Questions results page that is an **EXACT COPY** of the Static Interview Questionnaire layout.

### Step 1: Find the Static Questionnaire Page

Locate the file for the Static Interview Questionnaire results page. It's probably named something like:
- `CommonQuestions.jsx`
- `StaticQuestions.jsx`
- `InterviewQuestions.jsx`

Find it and tell me the exact file path.

### Step 2: Copy the ENTIRE Layout

The Smart Questions results page must have **THE SAME STRUCTURE** as Static Questionnaire:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [PAGE TITLE]                                                │
│ [SUBTITLE]                                                  │
│                                                             │
│ [4 DISPLAY LEVELS: Quick Review | With Example | ...]       │
│                                                             │
│ [QUESTION COUNT] [Expand All] [Collapse All] [PDF] [Word]   │
│                                                             │
│ ▼ Category 1 (count)                                        │
│ ▼ Category 2 (count)                                        │
│ ▼ Category 3 (count)                                        │
│ ...                                                         │
│                                                             │
│ [Back to Questions Service]                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: Only These Differences from Static

| Element | Static Version | Smart Version |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Page Title | "Common Interview Questions" | "Smart Questions for [Job Title] - [Company]" |
| Subtitle | "Master these questions and you'll be ready for any interview" | "Personalized questions based on your profile" |
| **NEW SECTION** | None | Add "Personalized for You" callout box (see below) |
| **NEW SECTION** | None | Add "Focus Areas for Your Preparation" section (see below) |

### The 2 Additional Sections for Smart (Insert AFTER title, BEFORE display levels)

**Section A: Personalization Callout**
```jsx
<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
    <span className="text-blue-600">✨</span>
    <span className="font-semibold text-blue-900">Personalized for You</span>
  </div>
  <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
    These questions were generated specifically for your background and this role.
    Unlike generic questions, they're tailored to YOUR unique profile.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Section B: Focus Areas (keep current implementation)**
- Keep the existing Focus Areas component
- Position it after the callout box, before the display levels

---

## EXACT LAYOUT ORDER (Top to Bottom)

1. **Page Title** - "Smart Questions for [Job Title] - [Company]"
2. **Subtitle** - "Personalized questions based on your profile"
3. **Personalization Callout Box** - (Section A above)
4. **Focus Areas Section** - (Section B above)
5. **4 Display Level Buttons** - Quick Review, With Example, With Insights, Complete Guide
6. **Action Row** - "[X] questions [Expand All] [Collapse All] [PDF] [Word]"
7. **Question Categories** - Collapsible accordions with questions
8. **Back Link** - "← Back to Questions Service"

**NOTHING ELSE. NO OTHER ELEMENTS.**

---

## DO NOT ADD

I repeat - DO NOT add any of these:
- ❌ Upgrade banners
- ❌ Payment prompts
- ❌ "Coming Soon" labels
- ❌ Data sources banner (JD, X-Ray, CV icons)
- ❌ Additional introduction sections
- ❌ Footer action bars
- ❌ Any decorative elements not in Static version

---

## VERIFICATION

After making changes, the Smart Questions page should look **almost identical** to Static Questionnaire, with only:
1. Different title/subtitle
2. Added personalization callout
3. Added focus areas section
4. Personalized question content (from AI)

**Everything else must be EXACTLY the same as Static Questionnaire.**

---

## SHOW ME YOUR WORK

Before finalizing, show me:
1. The file path of Static Questionnaire you're copying from
2. The file path of Smart Questions you're modifying
3. A summary of ONLY the changes you're making

**Do not make changes without confirming these first.**

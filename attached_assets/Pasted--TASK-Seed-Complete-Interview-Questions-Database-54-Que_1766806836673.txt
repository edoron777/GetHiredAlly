## TASK: Seed Complete Interview Questions Database (54 Questions)

### OVERVIEW
Replace the current interview questions with the complete pool of 54 questions organized into 5 categories.

### STEP 1: Create Category Descriptions Table

Run this SQL in Supabase:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS question_categories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    category_key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    category_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    question_format TEXT,
    answer_method TEXT,
    display_order INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE question_categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read categories" ON question_categories FOR SELECT USING (true);

### STEP 2: Update the Static Questions File

Replace the contents of backend/static_questions.py (or create it) with:

### STEP 3: Update the Seed Function

Update the seed endpoint to:
1. Clear existing questions (DELETE FROM interview_questions)
2. Clear existing questions_to_ask (DELETE FROM questions_to_ask)
3. Clear existing categories (DELETE FROM question_categories)
4. Insert all category descriptions from CATEGORY_DESCRIPTIONS
5. Insert all 54 questions from INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS
6. Insert all 11 questions to ask from QUESTIONS_TO_ASK
7. Return success message with counts

### STEP 4: Update the Database Schema

Make sure the interview_questions table has these columns:
- good_answer_example TEXT (new column if missing)
- what_to_avoid TEXT (new column if missing)

Run this SQL if needed:
ALTER TABLE interview_questions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS good_answer_example TEXT;
ALTER TABLE interview_questions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS what_to_avoid TEXT;

### STEP 5: Call the Seed Endpoint

After updating the code, call POST /api/questions/seed to populate the database.

CALIBRATION UPDATE - CV Scoring Weights

Testing revealed scoring issues:
- LinkedIn URL missing penalized too heavily
- High-quality CV scored 69% (should be ~80%)
- After-fix showed 95% (unrealistic, should cap at 88%)

MAKE THESE CHANGES:

=== FILE 1: backend/common/scoring/config.py ===

Update these values:

SCORING_VERSION = "1.1.0"

SCORE_MIN = 15

AFTER_FIX_MAX = 88  # ADD THIS NEW VARIABLE

CATEGORY_WEIGHTS = {
    "grammar": 10,        # Was 15
    "formatting": 12,     # Was 15
    "quantification": 25, # Was 20
    "language": 15,       
    "contact": 5,         # Was 10
    "skills": 13,         # Was 10
    "experience": 15,     # Was 10
    "length": 5           
}

GRADE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "excellent": 82,    # Was 85
    "good": 68,         # Was 70
    "fair": 52,         # Was 55
    "needs_work": 35    # Was 40
}

FIXABILITY_RATES = {
    "grammar": 0.70,        # Was 0.85
    "formatting": 0.60,     # Was 0.80
    "language": 0.65,       # Was 0.80
    "quantification": 0.35, # Was 0.50
    "skills": 0.40,         # Was 0.60
    "contact": 0.80,        # Was 0.30
    "experience": 0.15,     # Was 0.20
    "length": 0.50          # Was 0.40
}


=== FILE 2: backend/common/scoring/categories/contact.py ===

Update the point values in calculate_contact_score:

    if has_name:
        score += 1.5      # Was 2.0
    if has_email:
        score += 1.5      # Was 3.0
    if has_phone:
        score += 1.0      # Was 2.0
    if has_linkedin:
        score += 0.5      # Was 2.0 - KEY CHANGE
    if professional_email:
        score += 0.5      # Was 1.0


=== FILE 3: backend/common/scoring/after_fix.py ===

1. Add AFTER_FIX_MAX to the import:
   from .config import SCORE_MIN, SCORE_MAX, CATEGORY_WEIGHTS, FIXABILITY_RATES, AFTER_FIX_MAX

2. Change the cap line from:
   after_score = max(SCORE_MIN, min(SCORE_MAX, after_score))
   
   To:
   after_score = max(SCORE_MIN, min(AFTER_FIX_MAX, after_score))


=== RULES ===
